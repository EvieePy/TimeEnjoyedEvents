**About CodeJam:**
__Who__: Anyone who wants to code!

__Why__: We thought it would be fun to host community challenges, so welcome to our first ever Codejam!
The goal of this codejam is just to try making things with others. Sharpen our collaborative and creativity skills, and hopefully enjoy the process.

__What__: Without knowing the theme, the category for CodeJam 2023 is Twitch-integration. Think chat-bot, stream overlay, Twitch extension, browser extension, IDE extension... but something that can be used for chatters or streamers. There will be a theme however, which will be released on `July 7th`.

__Purpose of theme__: Whatever you end up making, make sure you use the provided theme! The more creative you get with the theme, the better!

__When__:
- Signups: June 1st - July 6th
- Start: July 7 (theme released)
- Ends: July 16th (submit your project!)

__Where__: TimeEnjoyed's Discord/Twitch community

**Signing Up:**
In order to make collaborating easier, when you click 'Signup', you will get a message that prompts you to select your Timezone, Programming Language preferences, and Team Size preference (solo or group).

**Next Steps:**
- If you're entering solo, just create a team for yourself by July 7th.
- If you want to be part of a team, please feel free to self-organize in <#1113869560706244730>. If you'd like our assistance, any <@&1099191306359672894> can help find a team for you.

**Creating Team (solo & group):**
Once you've found team members, please designate a team leader, someone who will be in charge of creating the team. When a team is created, a new text channel and voice channel will be created as a meeting ground for everyone in the team. These two channels will be accessible to team members only (as well as <@&1099191306359672894>).
- To create a team: The team leader will type `/team create <team name>` anywhere in this server.
- Soloists, go ahead and also create a team with `/team create <team name>` by July 7th.
- Note: The team name can **not** be changed. To leave the the team use `/team leave`. There are very strict rate-limits on creating and leaving teams. Please be certain of your name before creating a team.

**Commands:**
`/team create <team name>` - Creates a team with the given name.
`/team invite` - Retrieves your teams unique invite code.
`/team join <code>` - Join a team with the provided invite code.
`/team leave` - Leave your current team.

**On July 7th:**
